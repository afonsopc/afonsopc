# Hi, I'm Afonso

Software developer with experience in web development, backend services, and systems programming, currently studying programming and continuously improving my technical foundation.

I manage VPS and on-premise servers as part of my workflow, working in Unix environments with deployment, networking, and infrastructure tasks alongside development.

Some of my projects include:  
- *Google Drive style file storage platform* ([omelhorsite.pt](https://omelhorsite.pt))

I enjoy combining full-stack web development with systems-level and performance-oriented projects, always focused on writing clean, maintainable software and understanding how systems work under the hood.
