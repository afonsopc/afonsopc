# Hi, I'm Afonso 👋

Software developer with 4+ years of full-stack experience, including 2 years of professional work using **JavaScript** and **Ruby on Rails**, building web applications, APIs, and system integrations.  

I have delivered professional projects such as **company-wide dashboards**, **expense management systems with automated document generation**, **real-time error management workflows**, and **internal documentation interfaces**, leveraging technologies like **React, Ruby on Rails, Rust, Sidekiq**, and **Slack integrations**.  

I also manage VPS and on-premise servers, ensuring reliability, scalability, and performance, while continuously studying programming and improving my technical skills.  

I enjoy tackling both high-level web applications and low-level systems projects, combining creativity 🎨 with performance ⚡ and maintainability 🧰. I maintain my own platforms online with active users 👥, keeping hands-on experience in production environments.

Some of my projects include:

Through these projects, I’ve developed a strong understanding of both web and system-level development, focusing on **clean code, maintainable architectures, performance optimization, full-stack engineering, and deployment best practices**. I’m always exploring new tools, frameworks, and techniques to improve performance ⚡ and deliver impactful software 🚀.
